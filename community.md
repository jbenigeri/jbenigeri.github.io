### British School of Paris Jazz Band
**Founder & Musician** | 2016–2018

I started the Jazz Band at the British School of Paris, bringing together students who shared a passion for jazz and live performance. With the support and guidance of my music teacher, Simon Lockwood, we rehearsed regularly, performed at school events and in the local community of Croissy-sur-Seine, in the Paris suburbs. In 2018, I was nominated for a [COBIS Student Achievement Award](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1530883370/cobis/lxnhk8vvgkrqrvd1ns96/StudentAchievementAwardList_2018_3.pdf) for this contribution to school life.

## ⚽ Football

### Paris Saint-Germain
**Ligue 1 & Champions League**

I follow Ligue 1 and the Champions League, and I'm a huge PSG supporter. The club's colors—navy blue, red, white, and gold—inspired the theme and styling of this website. Ici, c'est Paris! 🔵🔴
